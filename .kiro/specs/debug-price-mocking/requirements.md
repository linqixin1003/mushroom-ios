# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Debug Price Mocking feature will allow developers to override subscription prices in debug builds for testing purposes. This will enable developers to test the UI appearance with specific price values without relying on actual StoreKit responses, which can be inconsistent in the development environment. The feature will be particularly useful for UI testing, screenshot generation, and verifying how different price formats appear in the app's subscription screens.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to mock subscription prices in debug builds, so that I can test the UI appearance with specific price values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is running in DEBUG mode THEN the system SHALL provide a way to override subscription prices
2. WHEN price mocking is enabled THEN the system SHALL display the mocked prices instead of actual StoreKit prices
3. WHEN price mocking is disabled THEN the system SHALL display the actual StoreKit prices
4. WHEN the app is running in RELEASE mode THEN the system SHALL ignore any price mocking configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily configure mocked prices for different subscription types, so that I can test various price scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring mocked prices THEN the system SHALL allow setting specific values for yearly and monthly subscriptions
2. WHEN configuring mocked prices THEN the system SHALL support different currency formats
3. WHEN mocked prices are configured THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect these changes in the UI

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to toggle price mocking on and off without recompiling the app, so that I can quickly switch between mocked and real prices during testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is running in DEBUG mode THEN the system SHALL provide a runtime toggle for enabling/disabling price mocking
2. WHEN price mocking is toggled THEN the system SHALL update all price displays immediately
3. WHEN the app is restarted THEN the system SHALL remember the previous mocking configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see clear indicators when price mocking is active, so that I don't confuse mocked prices with real ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN price mocking is active THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator in the debug UI
2. WHEN price mocking is active THEN the system SHALL log relevant information to the console
3. WHEN taking screenshots with mocked prices THEN the system SHALL provide an option to hide the mocking indicators
